##  Project Brief
The main objective of this project is to collect user information (name and age), process it using JavaScript logic, store it with localStorage, and display meaningful personalized feedback.

### Key Features
- **Personalized Greeting:** Retrieves user information from localStorage and dynamically generates a greeting using template literals.  
- **Age Calculation:** Converts the user’s age in years to months.  
- **Conditional Age Verification:** Uses `if...else` logic to determine eligibility for adult content.  
- **Motivational Quotes:** Renders a motivational quote five times using a loop.  
- **Persistent User Experience:** Data persists across page reloads with localStorage.
